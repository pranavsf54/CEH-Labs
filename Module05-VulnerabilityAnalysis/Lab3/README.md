# Lab 3: Perform Vulnerability Analysis using AI

## Objective

To utilize AI-driven tools (**ShellGPT**) to orchestrate vulnerability assessments. This lab demonstrates how to use natural language prompts to execute complex scans using standard industry tools like **Nikto**, **Nmap**, and **Skipfish** against various web targets.

## Lab Environment

* **Attacker Machine:** Parrot Security (User: `attacker`, Password: `toor`)
* **Target Systems:**
* `https://www.certifiedhacker.com`
* `http://www.moviescope.com`
* `http://testphp.vulnweb.com`


* **Tools Used:**
* ShellGPT (`sgpt`)
* Nikto
* Nmap
* Skipfish
* Firefox



## Lab Scenario

Conventional vulnerability analysis often requires memorizing specific flags for dozens of tools. AI-driven analysis changes this paradigm. By using ShellGPT, an ethical hacker can describe the *intent* ("Scan this site for vulnerabilities"), and the AI determines the best tool and syntax to execute. This lab focuses on automating web server scanning and application reconnaissance using this AI-assisted workflow.

## Steps Taken

### Task 1: Configure ShellGPT

1. **Initialize ShellGPT:**
* **Action:** Launched the Parrot terminal as root (`sudo su`) and ran the configuration script.
* **Command:**
```bash
bash sgpt.sh
# Entered Activation Key when prompted

```





### Task 2: Automated Web Server Scanning (Nikto)

1. **Execute Nikto via AI:**
* **Action:** Requested ShellGPT to scan a target for server misconfigurations using Nikto.
* **Prompt:**
```bash
sgpt --chat nikto --shell "Scan the URL https://www.certifiedhacker.com to identify potential vulnerabilities with nikto"

```


* **Execution:** Typed `E` and pressed **Enter** to run the generated command.
* **Observation:**
* The AI generated the correct syntax to launch Nikto against the SSL-enabled site.
* Nikto began enumerating server headers, identifying the web server version, and checking for potentially dangerous files (e.g., `robots.txt` entries).





### Task 3: Network & Service Vulnerability Scanning (Nmap)

1. **Execute Nmap Vuln Scan via AI:**
* **Action:** Requested a vulnerability scan against a different target using Nmap's scripting engine.
* **Prompt:**
```bash
sgpt --chat vuln --shell "Perform vulnerability scan on target url http://www.moviescope.com with Nmap"

```


* **Execution:** Typed `E` and pressed **Enter**.
* **Observation:**
* The AI likely utilized `nmap --script vuln` or similar flags.
* The scan checked open ports and attempted to match running services against known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).





### Task 4: Web Application Reconnaissance (Skipfish)

1. **Execute Skipfish via AI:**
* **Action:** Requested a deep web application security scan against a test application.
* **Prompt:**
```bash
sgpt --chat vuln --shell "Perform a vulnerability scan on target url http://testphp.vulnweb.com with skipfish"

```


* **Execution:** Typed `E` and pressed **Enter**.
* **Observation:** Skipfish began mapping the site structure, probing for SQL injection points, and analyzing directory depth.


2. **Analyze Skipfish Report:**
* **Action:** Once the scan completed, located the output directory (typically `/tmp/skipfish_scan_output/` or similar, as indicated by the AI command).
* **Command:**
```bash
cd /tmp/skipfish_scan_output/
# Opened the report in Firefox
firefox index.html

```


* **Observation:** The browser displayed a sophisticated graphical report detailing the site map, document types, and identified security risks categorized by severity.



## Observations & Analysis

* **Abstration of Complexity:** The primary value demonstrated here is abstraction. Instead of recalling that Skipfish requires an output directory flag (`-o`) or that Nikto needs `-h` for the host, the user simply states the goal.
* **Tool Selection:** The AI correctly associated specific targets and goals with appropriate tools (e.g., Nikto for general server config, Nmap for service vulnerabilities, Skipfish for application crawling).
* **Dynamic Response:** It was noted that AI-generated commands might vary slightly in syntax (e.g., output directory naming) between runs, requiring the operator to pay attention to the specific command generated before pressing `E`.
